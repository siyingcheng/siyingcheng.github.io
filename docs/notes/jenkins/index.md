## What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to
automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or
deploying software.

Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run
standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

> [_Here_](https://github.com/devopsjourney1/jenkins-101) is a good resource for learning Jenkins.
